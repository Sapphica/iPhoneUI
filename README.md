# 🎯 Project Info

## Purpose
Making iOS more intuitive and productive through a fully custom UI system.  
This project includes:

- Complete **system icon overhaul**
- **Text-to-speech** scripts for reading emails and messages
- **Real-time system monitoring** overlays
- **Web API + Live weather** inside the lock screen
- Custom **gesture engine** (drag-out to close apps, flip-up dock — *years before Apple*)
- Multiple **full OS-level theme builds**
- Real iOS-level modifications, not just HTML skins

> Only a **small portion** of the original system is on GitHub.  
> The real engine, applet loader, and OS patches remain private.

# ✨ Highlights From the Full Original Mod

- **Android-style flip-clock lock screen**, ported to iOS  
  with animated hot-air balloons + dynamic weather graphics.
- Fully themed **pink interface**: messages, dialer, keyboard, icons, and system chrome.
- **Voice-read email** system (first 10 lines auto-spoken).
- **Audible dialer**, notification SFX, and UI soundscape.
- **Gesture rewrites**:
  - Drag-out-to-close  
  - Flip-up dock  
  - Custom overlay transitions
- **Power-menu overlay** (pre-Control Center era).
- Three full OS builds — not just themes, but code-level behavior changes.

This repo: **safe, archival slice** of the full system.
